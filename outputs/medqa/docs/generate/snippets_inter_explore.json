Bilirubin is produced as a byproduct of hemoglobin breakdown and is metabolized in the liver. Excess bilirubin can indicate that the liver is too immature to eliminate it or that the body is producing too much. Breastfeeding frequently in the first few days can help lower the chances of developing jaundice. Poor latch may result in inadequate milk consumption, which can influence jaundice. ",

This condition results in a loss of bone mass, replacement of calcified bone structures with fibrous tissue, and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. Osteoclastic bone resorption is stimulated, releasing minerals such as calcium from the bone into the bloodstream."

The surface appears pale with a shiny, crinkled pattern and may have fissures and excoriation. The lesions are typically symmetric and can extend to perineal and perianal areas.
