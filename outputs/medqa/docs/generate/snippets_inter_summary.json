Infection during pregnancy can lead to microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. There have been no reported deaths from Zika virus during the initial infection, and it has been associated with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Diagnosis of Zika virus is performed by testing for the presence of Zika virus RNA in blood, urine, or saliva."

Bilirubin is produced as a byproduct of hemoglobin breakdown and is metabolized in the liver. Excess bilirubin can indicate that the liver is too immature to eliminate it or that the body is producing too much. Breastfeeding frequently in the first few days can help lower the chances of developing jaundice. Poor latch may result in inadequate milk consumption, which can influence jaundice. ",

            "Jaundice on the first day of life is always pathologic and requires immediate attention. Breast milk jaundice may occur during the first to second week of life and is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of hemolysis. Interruption of breastfeeding for 1 to 2 days results in a rapid decline of bilirubin levels. Early onset jaundice is often related to hemolysis, internal hemorrhage, or infection.",
