The documents mention that first-generation BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib, were developed earlier and specifically target the active site of BTK, covalently binding to the cysteine residue necessary for the enzyme's activity. Zanubrutinib, while a BTK inhibitor, is classified as a second-generation inhibitor due to its distinct chemical structure and mechanism of action, which enables greater potency and selectivity for BTK while reducing off-target effects.
