Document [1] and Document [4] also support this by describing how high-grade astrocytomas show more prominent microvascular proliferation and endothelial cell atypia, while lower-grade tumors have more mature and organized vasculature. These patterns are proposed as potential biomarkers for identifying aggressive astrocytomas and evaluating tumor progression.

MRI is highly sensitive in detecting various soft tissue injuries, such as articular cartilage injuries, meniscal tears, and ligamentous injuries. However, it has limitations in detecting certain types of chondral and osteochondral lesions and may fail to identify subtle tears in the menisci or ligaments. Arthroscopy, on the other hand, remains the gold standard for evaluating joint abnormalities due to its ability to directly visualize the interior of the joint, allowing for accurate diagnosis and surgical intervention. Given these limitations of MRI and the superior direct visualization provided by arthroscopy, MRI cannot fully substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in evaluating occult posttraumatic lesions of the knee.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
